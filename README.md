Source code for virtual codeday summer event
This is just my source code for the CodeDay Summer Event 2021
Demo name is Novus, created by the all powerful person Lux-ful#2724 on discord :)
To play the game you must have BlueJ installed (I think)
Once you download the game and open it on BlueJ, right click Game.java, and click void main(String[] args)
Once you click that, do not click anything else except the "ok" button
A new popup window should show up, with the demo displaying
Once that demo is up, have fun :D
